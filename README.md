# code-awesome-quiz

## Objective

The objective of this project is to develop a quiz application using HTML, CSS Javascript and a lot of DOM manipulation.
The user has an allocated time to answer all questions, as the user submit his/her answers the application let's the user know if the answer is correct or incorrect. For each incorrect answer there is a time penalty. At the end of the quiz the user will get a score and will be presented with a form to enter his/her initials. High scores are displayed

## Development Phase
